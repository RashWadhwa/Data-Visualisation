# What is Quarto?

Quarto is a **reproducible document system** for combining code, its results, and your composition in a single file. A Quarto document (`.qmd`) is just a text file that contains:

1.  A **YAML header** at the top between `---` lines.
2.  **Markdown text** for headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.
3.  **Code chunks** that are executed when you render the document.

Quarto can create many formats from the same source: HTML reports, PDFs, Word documents, slides, dashboards, books, and more.

# Anatomy of a `.qmd` file

- The **YAML header** sets the title, author, and output format.
- The **text** explains what you are doing.
- The **code chunk** runs R code and shows the result in the output document.

# Introduction to Dashboards

## What is a Quarto Dashboard?

In data science, we often need to communicate results quickly and effectively. 

A **traditional report** (like a PDF or Word doc) is linear: you read it from start to finish. 

A **dashboard**, on the other hand, is an **"at-a-glance"** interface. It allows users to:

- Monitor key metrics (KPIs).
- Explore data interactively (zooming, filtering).
- Compare different visualizations side-by-side.

Quarto allows you to build these complex layouts using the simple Markdown you already know, without needing to know HTML or CSS.
# From document to dashboard

To turn a regular Quarto document into a **dashboard**, you only need to change the `format` in the YAML header:

```yaml
format:
  dashboard:
    orientation: columns
```

Now, Quarto treats your headings as layout containers:

- `#` – **Pages** (top-level sections).
- `##` – **Rows or Columns**, depending on `orientation`.

You can use callouts to highlight important information.


::: {.callout-note}
## Tip of the day

::: {.callout-important}
## Important tip of the day
