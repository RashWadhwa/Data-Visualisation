# Overview

This portfolio serves as a comprehensive learning resource for modern data visualisation using the Grammar of Graphics framework in R. By moving from theoretical specifications to complex static charts and dynamic animations, this project demonstrates how design principles translate into reproducible insights.

# Key Learning Milestones:

- The SPEC (Planning): Establishing a structured specification (Aesthetics, Geometries, Scales) to ensure that any graphic produced is reproducible across different software environments.

- The Grammar of Graphics: Exploring the interplay between statistical transformations and coordinate systems to understand how visual perception changes based on data encoding.

- Static Complexity: Leveraging ggplot2 to visualise New York air quality trends, using facets and multiple aesthetics to reveal hidden correlations between weather patterns and ozone levels.

- Dynamic Storytelling: Implementing {gganimate} to visualise 70 years of global development, with a specific focus on the disruptive impact of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic on the United Kingdom's health and economic trajectory.

- Interactive Insights: Synthesising these findings into a Quarto Dashboard for high-level exploratory analysis and campus-specific mapping.
