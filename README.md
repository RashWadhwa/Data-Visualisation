# **Data Visualisation Portfolio**

# **Project Overview**

This portfolio serves as a comprehensive learning resource for modern data visualisation using the Grammar of Graphics framework in R. By moving from theoretical specifications to complex static charts and dynamic animations, this project demonstrates how design principles translate into reproducible insights.

## **Navigation & Access**

The project is hosted live via GitHub Pages. You can explore the full interactive dashboard and visualisations by visiting the link below:

## **How to Navigate the Site:**

**Sidebar/Navigation Bar:** Use the top or side menu to switch between different project modules (e.g., New York Air Quality, Global Development Animation, or the Campus Map).

**Interactive Dashboards:** In the Quarto Dashboard, use the available filters or tabs to drill down into specific data subsets.

**Code Visibility:** Most pages include a "Code" toggle button at the top right, allowing you to view the underlying R code used to generate the visualisations.

## **Project Highlights**
Include screenshots here to showcase your best work. For the best layout, place them under their respective milestone descriptions.

## **Milestone: Static Complexity (ggplot2)**
A faceted grid exploring the correlation between temperature, wind speed, and Ozone levels in New York.

## **Milestone: Dynamic Storytelling (gganimate)**
An animated time series illustrating the shift in global health metrics, with a focus on the 2020 pandemic anomaly.

Tip: To include screenshots effectively, create an assets/screenshots folder in your repository and use the Markdown syntax: ![Alt Text](./path/to/image.png).

## **What I Achieved**

This project represents a significant transition from a "chart-maker" to a "data storyteller." Through this portfolio, I have mastered:

**Grammar of Graphics Mastery:** I can now deconstruct any complex visual into its fundamental layers—data, mapping, statistics, and coordinates. This allows for total creative control over data encoding.

**Reproducible Research:** By using Quarto and the SPEC planning framework, I ensured that every insight is fully reproducible, making the analysis transparent and scientifically sound.

**Full-Stack Visualisation:** I successfully bridged the gap between static analysis and interactive deployment, creating a unified dashboard that serves both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Critical Data Analysis:** Beyond the code, I learned to identify and explain complex real-world events (like the COVID-19 impact) through data, turning raw numbers into compelling narratives.

## **Learning Milestones:**

- **The SPEC (Planning):** Establishing a structured specification (Aesthetics, Geometries, Scales) to ensure that any graphic produced is reproducible across different software environments.

- **The Grammar of Graphics:** Exploring the interplay between statistical transformations and coordinate systems to understand how visual perception changes based on data encoding.

- **Static Complexity:** Leveraging ggplot2 to visualise New York air quality trends, using facets and multiple aesthetics to reveal hidden correlations between weather patterns and ozone levels.

- **Dynamic Storytelling:** Implementing {gganimate} to visualise 70 years of global development, with a specific focus on the disruptive impact of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic on the United Kingdom's health and economic trajectory.

- **Interactive Insights:** Synthesising these findings into a Quarto Dashboard for high-level exploratory analysis and campus-specific mapping.
